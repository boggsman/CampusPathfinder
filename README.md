CampusPathfinder
================

This is a path-finding tool to help you find the shortest distance walking path on the Clayton State University Campus. It was created with the javascript game framework Phaser using an EasyStar.js plugin.

Using
================

It is written in Javascript. Drop it in a folder on your favorite web server and enjoy. 


Customizing
================

It is easily customizable with a different map image and tilemap. I created the tilemap using the Tiled map editor. Take a look at the files in the /assets folder and also Map.js.
